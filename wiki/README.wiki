= Introduction =

There does not seem to be a standard PDDL Parser in C++. pddl-parser-cpp (ppcpp, in short) is an attempt to fill this gap. 

The current version r5 of the parser is essentially incomplete. The only thing it is known to perform is able to read the domain file `samples/ipc2006/DOMAINS/openstacks/MetricTime/domain.pddl`. Defining the grammar for problem files and parsing the problem files still remains to be done. 
 
The parser is implemented using boost::spirit. 

= Roadmap =

  * Attach actions to the domain-parser to produce C++ objects.
  * Define grammar for the problem-parser.
  * Attach actions to the problem-parser to produce C++ objects. 
  * (Possibly) Move from boost::spirit::classic to using the new version of boost::spirit.
